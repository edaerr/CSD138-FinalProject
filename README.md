# CSD138-FinalProject
Final Group Project – SweetScoops Ice Cream Shop (CSD 138)

This project contains the full SQL implementation of a relational database system for SweetScoops, a fictional neighborhood ice cream shop. The database is designed to support real-world business operations, including managing products, customers, employees, and orders. It also demonstrates advanced SQL programming skills, including indexes, subqueries, views, stored procedures, and stored functions.

---

## 📘 Project Description
The goal of this project is to build a clean, maintainable, and fully functional SQL database that can recreate the entire SweetScoops system from start to finish. The database includes a well-structured schema, sample data, and several advanced SQL components required for performance and analytical tasks.

The final SQL script (`FinalProject.sql`) can be executed in MySQL Workbench to create the database, populate the tables, and run all programming components without errors.

## ▶️ How to Run the SQL Script

1. Open **MySQL Workbench**  
2. Create a new SQL tab  
3. Open `FinalProject.sql`  
4. Select *the entire script* (Ctrl+A / Cmd+A)  
5. Run it (lightning bolt icon)  
6. The script will:  
   - Drop the database (if it exists)  
   - Recreate the full schema  
   - Insert all sample data  
   - Create indexes  
   - Create the subquery, view, stored procedure, and stored function  
   - Run verification queries  

If the script runs without errors, the database is correctly implemented.
